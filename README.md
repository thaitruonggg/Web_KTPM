some key Funtion of this website:
- CRUD user
- Manipulate with mongoDB to save and retrieve data
- Cart for each user to add and view their product in advance
- Products can be filtered by price and category in Category page
- View order history for each account
- ... etc

some of our thought after this website is finished
- for the front-end : the interface was created with pure html and css, so the code organization is kinda messy and hard to config when we want to add or delete something. In the end, We have learned to use CSS fluently.
- for the back-end  : we have learn ExpressJS for the javascript backend framework, this stage is kinda frustrating in the start,  we find out there are a lot of things we still need to learn about web field, the final result is this website. The source code is still messy like the front-end, but in the other hand we have learn how the Back of the website work properly.
